           About the Project
            This project was inspired by our shared passion for technology and our desire to create a meaningful and impactful application. 
            As individuals who have always been fascinated by problem-solving and innovation, we wanted to develop a project that would not only showcase our skills but also provide value to users.
            The timeline for this project spanned several weeks, with countless hours spent brainstorming, designing, and coding. We took great care in ensuring that every feature and functionality was meticulously implemented and thoroughly tested.
            This project is a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, a prestigious institution that has provided us with the knowledge and tools to excel in the field of software engineering. We are proud to present this project as a testament to our growth and dedication to learning.
