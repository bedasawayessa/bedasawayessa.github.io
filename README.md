Build your portfolio project (Week 3): Project Landing Page

What is a Landing Page?
The Portfolio Project landing page is a webpage that presents information about the project without requiring the visitor to signup, login, or even use the application. It is possible that the Landing Page is also the main webpage for the project.

Let’s take a closer look at what makes a great landing page.

Open an incognito browser and visit google.com. What do you see? The page has a few links in the header and footer section, but the majority of the page is empty except for the Google logo, a text input field, a microphone icon and two clickable buttons “Google Search” and “I’m Feeling Lucky”.
